## **Problem Statement**

Students often face difficulties finding reliable and personalized educational resources amidst the overwhelming amount of available content. Without effective guidance, many learners waste time navigating irrelevant or low-quality materials, which hampers their learning progress and motivation.

---

## **Proposed Solution**

LearnMate is an AI-powered solution that integrates:
1. **Chatbot**: A conversational interface for students to specify topics, preferences, and learning goals.
2. **Recommendation Engine**: A machine learning system offering personalized and curated educational resources, including books, videos, articles, and online courses.

LearnMate simplifies access to quality resources, enabling students to focus on learning rather than searching.

---

## **Features**

### **Chatbot:**
- User-friendly interface to engage users conversationally.
- Interactive queries to refine and personalize recommendations.
- Support for multiple languages to broaden accessibility.

### **Recommendation Engine:**
- Collaborative filtering to suggest resources based on similar users’ preferences.
- Content-based filtering to tailor suggestions based on user-specific inputs.
- Categorized results for books, videos, articles, and online courses.

---

## **Data Sources**

To ensure a diverse and high-quality dataset, LearnMate will gather data from multiple sources, including:
- **Kaggle**: Use pre-existing datasets such as educational video metadata, eBook collections, and course details.
- **Open Educational Resources (OER)**: Collect freely available textbooks, articles, and academic materials.
- **YouTube**: Scrape metadata for educational videos using APIs.
- **Custom User Feedback**: Build a growing dataset through chatbot interactions and user-submitted preferences.

Data preprocessing will include cleaning, deduplication, feature extraction, and standardization to ensure high-quality inputs for machine learning models.

## **Technical Details**

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Use Kaggle datasets to bootstrap the system with initial resources.
   - Clean and preprocess data to handle missing values, normalize formats, and remove duplicates.
   - Perform feature engineering to extract key attributes, such as resource difficulty level, category, and relevance.

2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
   - Implement hybrid recommendation techniques: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and ensemble methods.
   - Use NLP models (e.g., BERT) for understanding user queries and matching resources effectively.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Host the application on a scalable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
   - Develop a web-based frontend using Vue.js and connect it to the backend API built with FastAPI.
   - Containerize services using Docker to ensure scalability and portability.

4. **MLOps**:
   - Automate testing and CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous model updates and deployment.
   - Monitor the application’s performance using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Implement version control for models and dependencies to maintain reproducibility.
